Welcome to your Code Playground.

In this workshop, we will be exploring a few simple coding tricks.
Here is a list of what we will cover:

- Hover states
- CSS transitions
- CSS transforms (rotate, scale, filters)
- Round corners
- Custom cursors
- Keyframe animations
- Draggable elements
- Media queries

There is a selection of placeholder images in the `assets` folder to the left, or you can upload and use your own.

Try and follow along as much as you can and don't be afraid to experiment or break any code. You can always 'CMD + Z' or fork a new project.

"The goal should not be to program something amazingly complex but to develop effective design with simple means."

"Simple things are often overlooked in programming because there is much to explore. However, the possibilities of simple things are usually far from exhausted."

Housekeeping:

← `index.html`: This is the main HTML page for your website.

← `styles.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

← `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.

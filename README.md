#### Hello student,

This is your code playground for today.
In this workshop, we will be exploring a few simple coding tricks :D

Here is a list with some instructions:

1. Hover states
2. Custom cursors
3. CSS transforms (rotate, filter effects, scale)
4. Updating classes with Javascript
5. Keyframe animations
6. Draggable elements
7. SVG elements
8. ??

Try and follow along as much as you can and don't be afraid to experiment or break any code... you can always fork a new project üòà

This playground contains a selection of placeholder images which you can find in the `assets` folder to the left, but feel welcome to upload your own to use.

#### What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `index.html`: This is the main HTML page for your site.

‚Üê `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

‚Üê `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.

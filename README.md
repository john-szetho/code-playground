#### Hello student,

This is your code playground for today.
In this workshop, we will be exploring a few simple coding tricks :D

Here is a list with some instructions:

1. Hover states
2. Custom cursors
3. CSS transforms (rotate, filter effects, scale)
4. Updating classes with Javascript
5. Keyframe animations
6. Draggable elements
7. SVG elements
8. ??

Try and follow along as much as you can and don't be afraid to experiment or break any code... you can always fork (aka. remix) a new project.

There is a selection of placeholder images in the `assets` folder to the left but you are welcome to upload and use your own.

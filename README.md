"Simple things are often overlooked in programming because there is much to explore. However, the possibilities of simple things are usually far from exhausted."

Step 1:
Make a copy of the source files by clicking "Remix" on the right-side of the header.

Step 2:
Open the `index.html` file from the navigation panel on the left and have a look around.

Step 3:
Copy and paste the `section` element to create new box elements.

Step 4:
Have a go at using hover states on the boxes. Be sure to reference the Simple Tricks section of the presentaiton.

Step 5:
Have a go at implementing CSS transform effects, such as rotate, scale, translate.

Step 6:
Have a go at uploading your own image to `Files` from the navigation panel on the left, then display it in the box element using an `<img>` tag.

Step 7:
Have a go at implementing a media query that changes the style of a box for smaller screen sizes.

Step 8:
Have a go at implementing a script to change the background colour of the box on click.

Step 9:
If you made it this far, nice job (!!!). Ask me for more tasks.
